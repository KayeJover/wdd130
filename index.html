    <p>Hello! My name is Kaye Gualingco, and I am from Bacolod, Philippines.I am 20 years old, turning 21 this April. I love to read romance novels, dance, cook, and travel. Last year, I completed my BYU Pathway, which was a significant accomplishment for me. Currently, I am pursuing a course in software development to further enhance my knowledge and skills. While this course is challenging for me, especially since I only have basic knowledge of computers, I am determined to succeed. I believe that with faith and perseverance, I can overcome any obstacles that come my way. My ultimate goal is to earn a degree from BYU-Idaho and use the skills and knowledge I acquire to pursue a successful career in software development.</p>
