            <h2>HIISTORY</h2>
            <p>White Water Rafting was founded in 1990 by Gilda and Rodolfo Gualingco. The married couple really loves to adventure and explore outdoor activities. One day, they tried to go water rafting. They started with just the two of them to explore using the inflatable rafting boat and paddles.It was challenging for them, but with their teamwork, they made it.

                The couple wanted to share with others the experience they had,particularly in whitewater rafting. The couple started to build their own company with their children, and with the use of social media, many people know about their rafting activities.</p>
